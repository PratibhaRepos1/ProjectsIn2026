# DSA Notes

## Big O Notation

### Definition
Big O notation is used to describe the performance of an algorithm in terms of time and space complexity.

## Time Complexity and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity
- Measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases
- Common complexities: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), O(2ⁿ), O(n!)

### Space Complexity
- Measures how much additional memory an algorithm needs relative to input size
- Includes both auxiliary space and input storage

## Frequency Counter Pattern

### Overview
A technique that uses objects or maps to collect frequencies of values in a dataset.

### Use Cases
- Comparing patterns in different datasets
- Finding duplicates
- Checking if one dataset is an anagram of another
- Validating input patterns

### Benefits
- Avoids nested loops (reduces time complexity)
- Typically O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity
